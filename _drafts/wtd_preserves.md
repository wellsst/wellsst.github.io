# Preserves - whats the Diff??

jams are made from actual fruit, 
jellies are made from fruit juice. 

Preserves have chunks of fruit, 
conserves have dried fruit or nuts, 

 marmalades have peel and pulp.  It's bitter, not sweet

Related but not sweet preserves:

Chutneys use vinegar as the preservative rather than the sugar like jams.

compote - Fruit, usually dried fruit that’s reconstituted, and cooked with sugar. It’s usually more like fruit in syrup, rather than something spreadable.

fruit "butters." Which are basically fruit that has been churned making it spreadable.

Curd , famously Lemon curd, made with butter and eggs.



Marmalade is a citrus spread made from the peel and pulp of the fruit. Marmalades are cooked for a long time and have no pectin, and are used as spreads and glazes.  

Marmalade can also only be made from citrus 

No added pectin, citrus fruits have naturally occurring pectin so by adding the peel and cooking it down it gets activated and doesn't need extra.

Marmalade is a Portuguese loneword. In Portuguese it referes to a quince (marmelo) preserve hence the name.

Australian/British Jelly comes as powder, is mixed with hot water in a bowl/mold, then sets in the fridge. When ready, it is a solid(not liquid) but is very wobbly. It's also sold already mixed in small cups, sometimes with chunks of fruit in it. Pretty sure American TV has informed me that it's called "Jello Mold" in the states. Jell-o is the brand name

Can use any of these to glaze baked meats
