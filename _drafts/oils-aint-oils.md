# Comparing edible Oils

There was an advertisement on Australian TV in the late 80's that spruiked the famous line
("Oils ain't oils")[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVIOZR9Sy4Q].
Sure it was for vehicle oils, the ad showing that you shouldn't just put any oil in your car
you should use Castrol only vs putting in any cheap other brand.

But what is the recommendation for putting any old oils into your most important vehicle...your body?

## The importance of oils

Derived from plants and animals they're a fuel, long burning.

They are for vital functions and help in the absorption of Vitamins ? ?  
Oils themselves also contain many other useful molecules such as Omega-3s or harmful ones such as Omega-6?

## Taxonomy of oils

Commonly used plant derived oils:

    Coconut oil
    Corn oil
    Cottonseed oil
    Olive oil - Extra virgin is derived from centrifugal force to separate the oil from water, virgin and standard are containing quantities of EVOO mixed with lesser quality.  Good EVOO has a high smoke point and with its antioxidants, vitamins A, D, E and K make it one of the best oils to consume. 
    Palm oil
    Peanut oil
    Rapeseed/canola oil
    Safflower oil
    Sesame oil
    Soybean oil
    Sunflower oil
    Avocado

It must be noted that even each of these oils will have differences depending on factors such as how they were processed, the sources of the oil (could contain contaminates), storage, handling, how long from source to table.

Commonly used animal derived oils/fats:    

Since animal oils are typically in the form of fats, which is a more complex molecule so they are solid at room
temperature and will be rendered down upon applying heat.

Foods containing larger amount of animal derived fats:
Milk 
Butter
Cheese
Lard

Kitchen rendering of fats:  butter into clarified butter, suet into tallow, pork fat into lard, and chicken fat into schmaltz

These can be broken in 3 groups

   * Saturated oils are solid at room temperature; this describes shortenings, margarine,
   and a few other commonly eaten oils.  Typically these processed fatty oils are derived from 
   animal sources.  They are considered to be relatively unhealthy because 
   they can contribute to higher cholesterol levels and heart disease.

   * Monounsaturated oils are liquid at room temperature but begin to solidify in the refrigerator. 
   These include olive oil and peanut oil.

   * Polyunsaturated oils remain liquid when at room temperature or when chilled. 
   These include canola, sunflower, and walnut oils (among others). 


## What happens when cooked

https://www.goodfood.com.au/good-health/are-you-cooking-with-the-right-oil-20150708-gi1agi:
Refined oils are more stable and better suited to high-temperature cooking such as deep-frying than unrefined (mechanically pressed such as extra virgin) oils. These oils tend to have higher smoke points, the temperature zone at which the oil starts to break down and give off acrid and sometimes toxic fumes.
antioxidants start to disappear when you raise the temperature
