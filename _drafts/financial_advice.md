This is the safe middle-of-the-road approach for the "average Joe" to achieve financial independence.

## Money grows

Just not on trees but in a market.  It's been shown time over that money invested wisely (how to do that?) can grow, money makes money.

A best case example is of $25000 invested in the stock market returning an average 10%/year for 30 years, this will explode to $400,000.

Rule of 7 ?  Doubles every 7 years

In economic term there is an opportunity cost if you didn't invest some of your cash in this way.

## Increase your income stream

These days its so popular to throw around the "side-hustle" term.  Popular with digital nomads to do blogging.  Some people can do well with this but at what cost?

Top places for income streams:

* Work for it
* grow money in the share market either directly or via managed funds
* Invest in property

It's difficult and tempting to try and time the market, what should I buy and when?  Follow the old adage of "its not about timing the market its about time in the market"

Dollar cost averaging -= keep pushing returns back in see Warren Buffett

## Never retire

Always nice to have the option though

## Scale down your home

If you reach an age where the kids are grown upi then consider scaling down and using that spare cash by putting it to work in other places.

Some people even house-sit for extended periods.

## Watch your outgoings

Money is easy to spend, except perhaps in Brewsters Millions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster%27s_Millions_(1985_film)

Rich Dad poor dad

Do you really need that latest Tesla, nice to have but at what cost.  This is not an investment its a liability

## Work with your significant other

Its important in anything that you and your partner present a united front or it's just not going to end well.  Sit down and have regular conversations about money, what are your individual and combined goals in life that solid finances are going to be required for.

## Give something back

If given or earned the opportunity, depending on where you live, then I implore you to give something back.  It doesnt have to be in financial ways but certainly it is a good thing to donate to a worthy and trustyworkty charity.  This alone can be thought of as a selfish endevour since giving really can make you feel good, it makes your heart grow and glow, try it, I dare you.

An early retirement, without retiring, presents you with a bit more time on your hands so use that time for the good of your community and consider applying yourself to something as simple as Meals on Wheels, volunteering at your local parkrun ...???

## Just one final question

When can I retire?  Or rather, have the option to.
