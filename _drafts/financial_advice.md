This is the safe middle-of-the-road approach for the "average person" to achieve financial independence...or at least head in the right direction.  

Everyone has their own options and stories on how to do this but here is what has worked for me.  This has been done by reasonably hard work but not sacrificing too much.  Luck plays a part, selling a house at the right time can help as can being born in a good place to live.  But no matter luck or environment you have these principals still hold true to help you get ahead in money terms.  I've seen the flipside to this "middle-of-the-road" approach a.k.a get rich quick and it just generally doesn't work, it might a couple of times but too often that gung-ho approach will fail, don't throw good money after bad.

## Money grows

Not on trees kids, but in a market.  It's been shown time over that money invested wisely will grow...money makes money.

A great case example is of $25000 invested in the stock market returning an average 10%/year for 30 years, this will explode to $400,000.  You may have seen this kind of thing before and it is a nice way of explaining a couple of things.

1. Money can grow, yes there is always risk, but my guiding general principal is that you only fail in anything by not giving it a go at all.  
2. Put some away and set it to work for you.  
3. Keep repeating this and the benefits will come.

But there are some major caveats with this that the buyer must be aware of:

1. Does it include all expenses and taxes?  Expenses may include brokerage, commissions.  This can eat away at the lovely looking 10%
2. Is the percentage gain shown just the best possible scenario?  Markets fluctuate and maintaining a 10% over 30 years likely wont happen in reality.  
3. Past performance is not an indicator for the future
4. Is inflation taken into account.  In Australia inflation has been generally low since the 2000s averaging about 2%, but even that is enough to devalue year-on-year that $400,000.

That said, if the actual return is 6% that is still far better than most historical interest rates you'll get.

Another way to illustrate this is with the Rule of 72 - this is a general way of calculating how long it will take to double your invested money.  Take 72 divided by the expected return, eg:

* Savings account @ 3%?  72 / 3 = 24; 24 years to double it
* Share fund returning 8%? 72 / 8 = 9; 9 years to double it

### The power of compounding

Albert Einstein illustrated famously that compound interest is "the most powerful force in the universe".  He added, “Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world.  He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.” 

### In summary: 

In economic terms there is an opportunity cost if you didn't invest some of your cash in this way.

Investing matters, percentages matter (depending on your risk profile), hidden costs/fees/inflation matters, time matters.

## Increase your income stream

These days its so popular to throw around the "side-hustle" term, this essentially means that it is good from a financial point of view to have multiple income streams.  This is nothing new but more recently is popular with digital nomads doing blogging and podcasting.  Some people can do well with this but at what cost?  Don't get obsessed or bogged down in it, you still have to have a life, money should only be there to support the life you need to maintain.  So yes pursuit it, give it a go, but in the end for most of us just having a day job will be more beneficial to your entire life-balance.

Popular income streams:

* Work for it - primary job or 'side-hustles'
* Grow money in the share market either directly or via managed funds
* Invest in property

It's difficult and tempting to try and time the market, what should I buy and when?  Follow the old adage of "its not about timing the market its about time **in** the market" also known as dollar cost averaging - buy regularly and incrementally if your situation allows for it.

## Never retire

Always nice to have the option though.

## Scale down your home

If you reach an age where the kids are grown up then consider scaling down and using that spare cash by putting it to work in other places.

Consider renting.  Your million dollar home could generate enough income stream to pay for your rent and more.

Some people even house-sit for extended periods.

## Watch your outgoings

Money is easy to spend, except perhaps in [Brewsters Millions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster%27s_Millions_(1985_film)), but in the majority of cases it's hard to get and easy to let it flow away.

According to Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki:
TODO: ....

Do you really need that latest Tesla, nice to have but at what cost.  This is not an investment its a liability.

## Work with your significant other

Its important in anything that you and your partner present a united front or it's just not going to go well.  Sit down and have regular conversations about money, what are your individual and combined goals in life that solid finances are going to be required for.  Have a plan (wo)man.  "One house, one spouse"

## Give something back

If given or earned the opportunity, depending on where you live, then I implore you to give something back.  It doesn't have to be in financial ways but certainly it is a good thing to donate to a worthy and trustworthy charity.  This alone can be thought of as a selfish endeavour since giving really can make you feel good, it makes your heart grow and glow, try it, I dare you.

An early retirement, without retiring, presents you with a bit more time on your hands so use that time for the good of your community and consider applying yourself to something as simple as Meals on Wheels, volunteering at your local parkrun or at an aged care facility.

## Just one final question

When can I retire?  Or rather, have the option to.  Gee who knows??  What is that magical number?  Let's try and pin it down to a formula.  But as I started of with this entire article, there are many opinions to this and there are many assumptions to take into account, but lets see...

Assumptions:
You own your home
You have no debt
You have no dependants
You live within a solid medical system so you don't expect to pay too much, (eg) if you break your spine, get cancer etc who will foot the bill and how much?

Variables:

1. What is your individual or combined yearly expenditure? This is what you need to cover so you don't eat into your money making principal.
2. What is your possible combined income streams?  eg from shares, rental properties, royalties, a part-time job or pensions?

Formula:
Income - Expenses = 0

If you get > 0 then well done to you.

Adding to this think about averaging this out over years.  In your early "retirement", you may get a positive cash flow, but as you get older and as time moves on things change and it's likely you'll get a negative cash flow and that is ok if you have a big enough war chest of funds.
