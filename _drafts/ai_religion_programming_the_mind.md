# Dangerous thought


There are tools among us that all have a good use, but also have a dark side

A kitchen knife of course lets us cut things up for cooking, but of course it could be used to kill and has, many times.  The list of these kinds of things goes on, guns, fertilizer invetor made the concetation camp gases, police forces/armies...

AI - has some incredible promise, creation of music, finding skin cnacers with a mobile phone, but of course there are many dark things such as killing robots or see Our final invention book (TODO)

Religion - see podcast

The common factor is that somewhere/somehow there is a corruption to cause this misuse.

Thankfully the majority of us use the tools for their intended purpose

Question: Do the benefits far outweigh the dark sides (and ramifications of them)?

In emergency situations we fall back to our default position or most basic of trainings (see soldiers for example), I've seen in Dementia patients a similar thing in that they fall back to traits that were seen years earlier eg sleeping a lot, talking too much, forgetfulness on a small scale.  I had thought too that the condition amplified certain traits but its more like certain traits such as anything in a normal living spectrum are filtered out or more accurately just lost...forever.
