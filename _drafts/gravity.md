# Gravity explained

What is gravity?  It is this so called 'force' that is all around pushing or pulling us toward each other, it is an imaginary or pseudo force.  It is something that we become totally accustomed to and entirely dependant upon for our existence.  

TODO: going to space is bad for humans due to lack of G
TODO: gravity help to for the atmosphere?  other ways it is essential

So from the human centric view it is something that we need but also something that can kill, think falling off a high cliff for example...too much of a good thing, the acceleration of gravity on earth is around 9.8 m/s2 with terminal velocity about 240 km/h, that sudden stop!  

But what about from the perspective of the universe from the atom to a black hole.  How can we visualize gravity from these perspectives?

Some definitions from famous physicists:
Wheeler said: "Gravity tells matter how to move; matter tells gravity how to curve."
Einstein tried to dumb it down by saying that mass warps space-time.  

Mass - the quantity of matter contained in an area. in another way how much force is required to move a bunch of matter around TODO: Smallest thing to have mass???
Warp - A change in the topology of a dimension, think perhaps of a rock hitting water causing ripples; the topology of the water has been warped.  Simply imagine just a simple curve
Spacetime - the classic 4 dimensions
  Space - 3 movement directions XYZ.  X = Left/Right, Y = Up/down, Z = Back/Forward
  Time - Present/Future

Imagine we had an empty box, a really big one.  Imagine it is split into lines going in the XYZ planes to visualize space that is set out evenly (TODO: diagram would be nice).  If we in the center we place an amount of mass, call it unit 100 amount, in there it then imagine the lines immediately surrounding it are being bent/warped, they get less warped each step away.  Our 3D set of co-ordinates (the points where each line intersects) has become non-linear/not aligned.  The lines closer in become closer together or more compressed closer to the mass.  It seems simple enough to visualize this.  The mass is telling how the space around it to curve. (How we'll explore later).  

From the point of view of any mass travelling along a path (over time) it is going in a straight line but as it nears a larger mass it heads straight along but on an ever increasing curved path as it nears the larger mass .

Now place some more mass of unit 1 on an outer boundary of our box, it too will warp the surrounding lines but not nearly as much.  Slowly step this smaller mass toward the larger one.  As it gets closer...TODO

OK, so at a certain level we can see that mass influences other mass...but, how at say the Quantum level is this information "transmitted"...this I'll investigate into the future.

Gravity "travels" at the speed of light; so if a blackhole appears suddenly 1 light year away if will take a whole year before we notice it's presence not only in the way that light is not being bent around it but also in the gravitational sense (assuming we are looking right in the place it was when it appeared, bearing in mind both you and the black hole would have moved a lot in that year relative to each other)   

How time slows down
Light or any massless particles has no mass eg gluon; should c be renamed the speed of massless particles?
For something travelling at the speed of light time has stopped; t = 0 ??? TODO: Confirm
For objects stationary (relative to something else eg an observer) t = 1; so things travelling at 10% speed of light would ahve t = 0.9 ???
Therefore our bunch of mass that warps our 4D spacetime, is actually causing objects nearer it (more gravity) to speed up (relative to some observer?) and therefore the trade-off is a slowing of time t.

Quoted from (reddit)[https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ahj48d/gravity_visualized_using_spandex_and_weights/]:

```
When looking at 4D space-time, you have coordinates (t, x, y, z). t (called coordinate time) is usually in units of meters, where x seconds equals cx meters (c = the speed of light).

To describe motion through space-time you generally parameterise by what's called proper time, usually denoted tau, and usually measured in units of seconds. So it becomes (t(tau), x(tau), y(tau), z(tau)).

When you're not moving through space, t = tau * c. It turns out that the "velocity" (it's properly called "four-velocity") of your movement is always c: If you're standing still, you're moving at speed c through time. If you're moving (through space), you're moving slower through time, such that the total (four-)speed is still c.
```
