Idea: Describe how being cuaght in the sandwich years has changed/taught you


## Expectation management

I thought by this time of life I'd have it all sorted out and would be living the "Dream", instead things can take a turn away from what you expected they'd be.  It's hard but you have to alter your expectations and not dwell on what things should have been.

Reset your perspectives:
Imagine you are playing golf, you think you've hit this great shot but it bounces and settles in a sand bunker, you could have a tantrum and get caught up in things like it's always me me me...or just accept that your ball is there, it always has been and the future is to get it out of there...move on.

## Empathy

## Its how we live

We are all going to die what matters is how we live.  It's becoming cliche.
