## Basics

Maxwells Demon is a thought experiment that seeks to find a loophole in a law.  In the classic case it is applied to the Physics 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.

The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is concerned with heat exchange in systems in that heat energy flows to obtain equilibrium; heat energy will flow from an area of high energy (temperature) to an area of low energy.  Otherwise stated as seeking maximum Entropy or the state of maximum disorder or randomness.  

[//]: # (This will occur by itself but of course can be disrupted and the flow can go in the opposite direction as in the case of refrigeration but )

The Laws of Thermodynamics are beautifully expressed by the British comedy Duo in the 1960's Flanders and Swan, go treat yourself...

## The Loophole

The term "Demon" was an intentional one that was introduced by Lord Kelvin, it was intended to mean mediating though rather than the obvious malevolent connotation.

Now imagine a large box that is separated completely except for a small gate that can allow a particle through.  The gate is controlled by our imaginary Demon.  Assume both sides of the box are at maximum entropy and that the 2 sides are in equilibrium.  Some particles are hotter than others and move therefore faster, hotter = faster.  The trick our Demon can pull is that when a particle can enter the gate he can open the gate based on its energy or speed so perhaps only allowing hotter particles one way and cooler ones the other, thus one chamber can get hotter than the other.  The Demon has decreased the overall entropy, no laws were broken as the Demon is just being selective.

## Can we build one?

Spoiler: No

The issue is with the 1st Law of Thermodynamics.  This is a version of the Law of Conservation of Energy (matter cannot be created nor destroyed but only converted from one state to another).  In Thermodynamics it states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant, energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created nor destroyed. 

So where does the Demon get its energy to do the work from?  Technically it is now part of the system, no system or work like this has yet been created to be 100% efficient.  In order to detect the particles and decide which is allowed through and open/close the gate there is a lot of effort put in, more than is gained the entropy change between the chambers.
