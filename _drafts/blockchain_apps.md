# What is it?

Blockchain emerged from the Bitcoin project back in 2008.  It is an underlying technology that ensures a distributed, de-centralised system in which all node of the network (all all parties however you want to term this)  have access to all records/transactions in the system/ledger.  These transactions are immutable, once added that block cannot be changed.  

IT has the attributes of being:

* Persistent
* Transparent
* Public 
* Auditable
* Append only ledger - no changes possible

Peer-to-peer trading (cut out the middle man like banks).  Validated by all in the network.  You cant see the content of the transactions but you know what has happened.

How do we take any asset and trade it - use blockchain

Trust is a major issue moving this technology forward.  We have moved from a centralised trust (eg a bank) to a distributed trust (everyone in the chain)

Blockchain is the answer, but what is the question?

Key components:

Public/private keys
Hashing - blocks have hashcodes
Merkel trees - A tree of hashes that form the relationships between blocks.  Ensuring then that no underlying transactions can be tampered with. 

## What is a block


A block comprises:

* Nonce - a string that will alter the blocks hash.  Certifies that a block is legitimate.
* Hash of the previous block
* Transactions
* Hash of the block

Blocks are mined which essentially means the value for the Nonce is solved for the hash of the block ??? explain better

Banks and Fin's are adopting BC first as this seems the most obvious applications

## Electricity trading, eg cars with batteries distributing power

Solar/wind and can sell excess and use IoT to facilitate the transfer of power.  Big cities could donate excess power to poorer areas

## IoT

Connected devices 

## Procurement of goods between companies?

## Insurance

## Contracts

## Supply chain improvements

Transactions are documented in a permanents decentralised ledger and can be monitored securely and transparently cutting.  Can monitor entire supply chain to reduce time, cost, labour, errors and allow improvements of the process.

Rigid contracts as bad actors in the chain could be boycotted.

## Agriculture

Fractional ownership - eg multiple farmers can part own a tractor/land - record keeping for each item used and time spent.  Input and output from the land can be tracked with blockchain

## Forecasting

## Gambling

Place bets on a race in a decentralised way, see: https://www.augur.net/

##  Voting

Prevent fraud used with processes in registrations, verification and vote counting

Immutable, publicly viewable ledgers of recorded votes would make elections more fair and democratic

## News

Can we prevent fake news?

## Uber v2 - decentralised ride sharing

Uber is not peer to peer as Uber is the middle man

Arcade CiIty  & LaZooz

Automatically pay for parking, tolls and fuel - good for driverless cars.

ewallets being developed by innogy, zf and ubs

## Data storage

Decentralised data storage

## Charity

Can track where donations are actually going

see: BitGive

## Chit funds ??  Kitty party

Parallel banking
