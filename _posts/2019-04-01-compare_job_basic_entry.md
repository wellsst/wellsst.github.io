# Fit enough?

Have you got what it takes to be considered for a physically demanding role?  

I came across a video recently that outlines the basic fitness level you should have before hitting an MMA gym.  It says you should get to a certain level of fitness before you waste time and money stepping up for instruction. Seems sensible. This is interesting so I decided to have a quick look at what it takes to just be considered for entry to certain fields that require at least a basic physical fitness.

All of these roles require more than raw physical grunt but they all require basic physical screening of applicants.  Here they are, see if you could cut it!

## WW2 US Marine

![](https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/09/boot.jpg)

To receive the highest-level score:
* 20 pull ups
* 75 jump squats
* 54 pushups
* 79 situps in 2 minutes
* Sprint 275 meters in 44 seconds

All within 2 hours

## Modern Marine

All must still be completed in a 2 hour period

### CFT

There is also a Combat Fitness Test that is quite different and *"requiring Marines in battle dress uniform to sprint a timed 880 yards, lift a 30-pound ammunition can overhead from shoulder height repeatedly for two minutes, and perform a maneuver-under-fire event, which is a timed 300-yard shuttle run in which Marines are paired up by size and perform a series of combat-related tasks"*

## Australian Commando

As expected the Special Forces screening test is a much higher level.  It's conducted over 7 hours and you will not know how you have done, there is no minimum just you against the other candidates!
