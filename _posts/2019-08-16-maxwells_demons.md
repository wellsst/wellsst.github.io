## Background

Maxwell's Demon is a thought experiment that seeks to find a loophole in a closed energy system.  It first was touted by James Clerk Maxwell, who was also one of the key participants in establishing the classic study of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is that branch of physics that is concerned with the study of heat and temperature and their relation to energy, work and essentially energy flows.  At his time in the 1870s there was much interest, thought and experimentation given to producing more highly efficient steam powered machines; how can we get maximum power out of a machine?  

The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is concerned with heat exchange in systems in that heat energy flows to obtain equilibrium; heat energy will flow from an area of high energy (temperature) to an area of low energy.  Otherwise stated as seeking maximum Entropy or the state of maximum disorder or randomness.  

[//]: # (This will occur by itself but of course can be disrupted and the flow can go in the opposite direction as in the case of refrigeration but )

The Laws of Thermodynamics are beautifully expressed by the British comedy Duo in the 1960's Flanders and Swan, go treat yourself...

## The proposed Loophole

The term "Demon" was an intentional one that was introduced by Lord Kelvin, it was intended to mean 'mediating' though rather than the obvious malevolent connotation.  It was small and cunning enough hypothetical creature that would be able to discern the energy and trajectories of individual molecules.  

So down to it...

Imagine a box (closed system) that contains a gas, evenly distributed in terms of energy or heat.  Each particle is moving around in it's own random trajectories and each has a certain amount of energy and therefore speed.  The box is separated completely except for a small gate that can allow a particle (of gas) through.  The gate is controlled by our imaginary Demon.  

Assume both sides of the box are at maximum entropy and that the 2 sides are in equilibrium.  Some particles are hotter than others and move therefore faster, hotter = more energy = faster.  The trick our Demon can perform is that when a particle can enter the gate it can open the gate based on the particles energy or speed so perhaps only allowing hotter particles one way and cooler ones the other, thus one chamber can get hotter than the other.  The Demon has decreased the overall entropy, no laws were broken as the Demon is just being selective.  From this you have one side hotter than the other from which you could run an engine from, for free.  
It has used information to power the system and not work.  But information requires or is energy.

According to the 2nd Law there's a natural tendency for things to degenerate, it's easier to break it than make it, and the whole universe is technically on this one-way slide to a soup of nothingness.  Happy days!

This idea of an omni-prescient being being able to know and predict where all these particles could be was surely also born in part out of the religious sentiments that were all so powerful at the time.

## Can we build one?

No.

Not one based on standard thermodynamics but possibly [in the Quantum realm - Observing a quantum Maxwell demon at work](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.05161.pdf))

The issue is with the 1st Law of Thermodynamics.  This is a version of the Law of Conservation of Energy (matter cannot be created nor destroyed but only converted from one state to another).  In Thermodynamics it states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant, energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created nor destroyed.  Even the gathering of the information (or measuring) about whether an individual molecule is fast or slow interferes with that molecule. 

So where does the Demon get its energy to do the work from?  Technically it is now part of the system, no system or work like this has yet been created to be 100% efficient.  In order to detect the particles and decide which is allowed through and open/close the gate there is a lot of effort put in, more than is gained the entropy change between the chambers.  See also the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics: 

> "If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other"

Update: we are now actually making them based on *information*, see: [Maxwellâ€™s Demon and the Thermodynamics

## My wacky idea

Have a kind of solid state, nano-gate that will only allow particles that are fast enough through, possible?
