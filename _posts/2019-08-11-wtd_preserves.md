# Preserves/Jams - whats the Diff??

## Jams, Jellies, Preserves, Conserves and Marmalades...what the diff?

Jams are made from actual fruit.  It is a cooked mix of fruit (either finely chopped, mashed or crushed) and sugar, placed into heat sterilized jars. 

Jellies are made from fruit juice or a cooked mix of fruit and sugar which is strained to give a clear liquid.  Typically does not require gelatin to set.  Not to be confused with UK/Australian Jelly.

Preserves cooked mix of fruit and sugar where the fruit is in large chunks.  Close to Jam then, yes it's true.

Conserves have high fruit content are a cooked mix of fruit, sugar, nuts, raisins, dried fruit and spices.

Marmalades have peel and pulp.  It's bitter mixed in with sweet

Curds, famously Lemon curd, made with sugar, butter and eggs and of course lemons.  Can't go wrong with that mix so it's damn nice.

## Related but not sweet preserves:

Chutneys use vinegar as the preservative rather than the sugar like jams.

Compote - Fruit, usually dried fruit that’s reconstituted, and cooked with sugar. It’s usually more like fruit in syrup, rather than something spreadable.

[Fruit "butters"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_butter) Which are basically fruit that has been churned making it spreadable.  Apple butter is a highly concentrated form of apple sauce produced by long, slow cooking of apples with cider or water to a point where the sugar in the apples caramelizes, turning the apple butter a deep brown. The concentration of sugar gives apple butter a much longer shelf life as a preserve than apple sauce.

## Recipies

### Typical Strawberry Jam recipe:

* 1kg strawberries - hulled and chopped into small chunks (as you see fit)
* 750g castor or fine sugar
* juice of 1 lemon

1. Place the strawberries in a bowl and gently toss through the sugar. Leave uncovered at room temperature for 12 hrs or overnight. This process helps the sugar to dissolve, ensures the fruit doesn’t disintegrate too much and helps to keep its vibrant colour.

2. Set over a low heat and cook very gently, add the lemon

3. When you can no longer feel any grains of sugar remaining, turn up the heat to start bubbling the jam and bringing it to the boil. (The sugar must be completely dissolved before increasing the heat, otherwise it will be difficult for the jam to set, and it may contain crystallised lumps of sugar.)

4. Meanwhile carefully clean and heat your jam jars in the oven at a low temperature for at least 30 mins - this will sterilize them.

5. Boil hard for 5-10 mins.

6. Let the jam settle for about 15 minutes

7. Pour into jars, allow to cool and preferably place in fridge.


## Disclaimer

I am not a chef but can cook a few things.  I made strawberry jam a few times.

## Additional Points

Marmalade is a citrus spread made from the peel and pulp of the fruit. Marmalades are cooked for a long time and have no pectin, and are used as spreads and glazes.  Marmalade can also only be made from citrus.  No added pectin, citrus fruits have naturally occurring pectin so by adding the peel and cooking it down it gets activated and doesn't need extra.

Marmalade is a Portuguese loneword.  In Portuguese it refers to a quince (marmelo) preserve hence the name.

Australian/British Jelly comes as powder, is mixed with hot water in a bowl/mold, then sets in the fridge. When ready, it is a solid(not liquid) but is very wobbly. It's also sold already mixed in small cups, sometimes with chunks of fruit in it. Pretty sure American TV has informed me that it's called "Jello Mold" in the states. Jell-o is the brand name

Can use any of these to glaze baked meats
