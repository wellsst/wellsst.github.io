# Gravity explainer

A short explainer to help get my mind around this immense topic.

What is gravity?  To the average being it is a 'force' that is all around pulling us toward each other, it holds us on the ground.  On earth it is something that we are fully accustomed to and are entirely dependant upon for our existence.  Putting humans in low-G for extended time periods such as going to space is bad for your health, we lose about 1% bone minerals per month (if you remain quite sedentary) and muscle mass also quickly diminishes.  Looking beyond humans gravity also plays a role in maintaining Earths atmosphere (Earths magnetic field plays a huge role as well).

So, from the human centric view, it is something that we need but also something that can kill; think falling off a high cliff for example...the acceleration of gravity on earth is around 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> with terminal velocity about 240 km/h, oh that sudden stop!  

But what about from the perspective of maths and physics that describe the universe, from the atom to a black hole.  How can we visualize gravity from these perspectives?

Some brief perspectives from physicists:
Wheeler said: "Gravity tells matter how to move; matter tells gravity how to curve."
Einstein tried to dumb it down by saying that mass warps space-time.  
Feynman - "Is it not possible that perhaps gravitation is due simply to the fact we do not have the right coordinate system?"

These simple words all kind of relate but they are really deep to understand.  

Breaking down on Einsteins work, probably the most famous of them:
* Mass - the quantity of matter contained in an area.  Or put another way how much force is required to move a bunch of matter around.
* Warp - A change in the topology of a dimension, think perhaps of a rock hitting water causing ripples; the topology of the water has been warped.  
* Spacetime - the classic 4 dimensions:
  * Space - 3 movement directions XYZ.  X = Left/Right, Y = Up/down, Z = Back/Forward
  * Time - Present/Future

Imagine we had an empty box, a really big one.  Imagine it is split into lines going in the XYZ planes, this will help to visualize space that is set out evenly (TODO: diagram would be nice).  At this point everything is neatly laid out in straight lines.

If we in the centre we place an amount of mass, call it unit 100 amount, in there it then imagine the lines immediately surrounding it are being bent/warped, they get less warped each step away. Our 3D set of co-ordinates (the points where each line intersects) has become non-linear/not aligned.  The lines closer in become closer together or more compressed closer to the mass.  The mass is telling how the space around it to curve. (How I'll explore later).  

Now place some more mass of unit 1 on an outer boundary of our box, it too will warp the surrounding lines but not nearly as much.  Give the smaller mass a little push toward  the larger one.  From the point of view of the unit 1 mass it is going in a straight line, following a line in our big box...but, the line itself is curved.  So the smaller mass will appear to head more toward the larger mass and will also increase in velocity as it "falls" down the curve (more so as it gets closer).

Say it again: from the point of view of any mass travelling along a path (over time) it is going in a straight line but as it nears a larger mass it heads straight along but on an ever increasing curved path as it nears the larger mass.  Put another way: moving objects follow geodesics paths in curved space.  This is essentially derived from of Einsteins General Relativity.

From this theory it seems that in essence gravity is an imaginary or pseudo force.

OK, so at a certain level we can see that mass influences other mass by warping (the fabric of) spacetime...but, how at the Quantum level is this done...how is this information "transmitted"...this I'll investigate in the future.

Gravity "travels" at the speed of light, the fastest speed information can travel at; so if a blackhole appears suddenly 1 light year away if will take a whole year before we notice it's presence not only in the way that light is not being bent around it but also in the gravitational sense (assuming we are looking right in the place it was when it appeared, bearing in mind both you and the black hole would have moved a lot in that year relative to each other)   

Maybe now E=mc<sup>2</sup> will make a little more sense, trying plugging some numbers into [Wolfram EM](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e%3Dmc2) and play with them.

## How time slows down

Light or other massless particles has no...mass, eg gluon; (should c be renamed the speed of massless particles?)

For something travelling at the speed of light, time has stopped; t = 0

For objects stationary (relative to something else eg an observer) t = 1; so things travelling at 10% speed of light would have t = 0.9.

Therefore our bunch of mass that warps our 4D spacetime, is actually causing objects nearer it (more gravity) to speed up (relative to some observer?) and therefore the trade-off is a slowing of time t.

Assisted explainer: quoted from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ahj48d/gravity_visualized_using_spandex_and_weights/):

```
When looking at 4D space-time, you have coordinates (t, x, y, z).

t (called coordinate time) is usually in units of meters, where x seconds equals cx meters (c = the speed of light).

To describe motion through space-time you generally parameterise by what's called proper time, usually denoted tau, and usually measured in units of seconds.

So it becomes (t(tau), x(tau), y(tau), z(tau)).

When you're not moving through space, t = tau * c.

It turns out that the "velocity" (it's properly called "four-velocity") of your movement is always c:

If you're standing still, you're moving at speed c through time.

If you're moving (through space), you're moving slower through time, such that the total (four-)speed is still c.
```

This all really opens up many more questions.  I'm just trying to make sense of popular theories on Gravity and as a result have kind of pushed them all together...at least my understanding has improved, but accurately?
