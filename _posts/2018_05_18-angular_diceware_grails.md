# Angular with Grails on Heroku

![Angular grails diceware](https://miro.medium.com/max/992/1*TU42-9rAUo242NuOOLdq3g.jpeg "Angular grails diceware")

I had pondered how to write and deploy a multi-project "full-stack" gradle project that uses Angular in the frontend and Grails in the back...that part was simple enough but what I needed was a place to deploy it, enter Heroku.


see my follow-up posts on doing the same'ish project with React deploy to PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry)
