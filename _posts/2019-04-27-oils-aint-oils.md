# Comparing edible Oils

There was an amusing advertisement on Australian TV in the late 80's that spruiked the catchphrase
("Oils ain't oils")[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVIOZR9Sy4Q].
Sure it was for vehicle oils, the ad showing that you shouldn't just put any oil in your car you should use Castrol only vs putting in any cheap other brand.

But what is the recommendation for putting any old oils into your most important vehicle...your body?

## The importance of oils

Edible oils are derived from plants and animals.  Basically they're a fuel, long burning as different to sugars which prove a quicker but shorter shot of energy.  Olive oil has been used to power modern Antarctic adventures, imagine consuming a liter of the stuff in a day just to maintain at least 12,000 calories/day intake. 

Oils are essential beyond being a fuel.  They also contain many other useful molecules such as Omega-3-6-9 fatty acids that the human body cannot produce by itself.   They protect your organs, keeep your body warm and are essential to the manufacture of hormones.

They also aid in the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K (careful of too much of a good thing though).  

There is also evidence to suggest that a diet with the right balance of good oils or fats can actually aid in weightloss since you will not be feeling hungry as much.

## Taxonomy of oils

Commonly used plant derived oils:

   *  Coconut oil - This oil is a controversial one. A solid at room temperature, coconut oil is a saturated fat — but not all saturated fats are created equal. Coconut oil has a high amount of medium-chain fatty acids, which are harder for the body to convert into stored fat. If you have a high cholesterol level then avoid this one.  Virgin coconut oil is removed from coconut milk by a process called wet extraction, largely free of refining;  it can reduce total and bad cholesterol.
Copra oil is extracted from dried coconut and requires some chemical refining, bleaching, and deodorizing. This may destroy some of the oil's compounds that promote heart health.

   *  Corn oil - a key ingredient in margarine and other processed foods.  Widely used in the USA and contains high amounts of Omega-6...too much of a good thing.  IT has many industrial uses as well, eg soap, textiles, bio-diesel, shampoo.  Often sourced from GM crops.  Chemically extracted high in polyunsaturated and saturated fats.

   *  Cottonseed oil - a byproduct of the cotton-growing industry. High in vitamin E. This highly stable (refined) oil was often used in chip shops for deep frying (you can use it multiple times before the smoke point is compromised).  A mix of predominantly saturated and polyunsaturated fats.

   *  Olive oil - Extra virgin is derived from centrifugal force to separate the oil from water, virgin and standard are containing quantities of EVOO mixed with lesser quality.  Good EVOO has a high smoke point and with its antioxidants, vitamins A, D, E and K make it one of the best oils to consume. 

   *  Palm oil - high in saturated fat, avoid if you are diabetic or have high cholesterol.

   *  Peanut oil - a.k.a groundnut oil. A good combination of fats, and has the good monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and is low in bad saturated fats. It's a good all-purpose oil for cooking.  Has a relatively high smoke point at about 230 degrees.

   *  Rapeseed/canola oil - (Canada oil low acid) lowest in saturated fat, rich in monounsaturated fats and is high in Omega 3. A medium smoking point but more stable at high temperatures because it's refined but the refining process itself raises questions about the healthiness of the oil.

   *  Safflower oil - THE lowest saturated fat content of any oil, just below canola.  Also has one of the highest smoke points at 265°C.

   *  Sesame oil - A good cooking oil with strong flavour.

   *  Soybean oil

   *  Sunflower oil - high quantity of vitamin E. a mixture of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a high smoking point, which means that sunflower oil holds onto its nutritional content at higher temperatures.  Diabetes sufferers should avoid this since it may increase blood sugar levels

   *  Avocado oil - high in monounsaturated fatty acids and can promote healthy cholesterol levels. Has a high smoke point and is therefore one of the best oils for high-temperature cooking.  High in Vitamin E. Store it in a cool dark place as it can spoil (oxidize) easily.

   *  Flaxseed (linseed) oil - good source of alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), one of three omega-3 fatty acids.  Should not be heated.  Tends to be a dietary supplement oil.

   * Grapeseed oil - is low in saturated fat and has a high smoke point, which makes it a healthy choice for all kinds of cooking and grilling

   * Macadamia oil - mechanically extracted in a technique similar to extra virgin olive oil. High in monounsaturates (about 80 per cent), it's more stable than many other polyunsaturated fats and has a high smoke point.

   * Rice bran oil - Extracted from the bran and the germ, has a relatively high smoke point. Equal amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated - and some good plant sterols but it's industrially processed, not mechanically extracted 

   * Vegetable oil - Could be anything.  In Australia with a lot of canola oil it is probably 99% canola but check the packaging!

It must be noted that even each of these oils will have differences depending on factors such as how they were processed, the sources of the oil (could contain contaminates), storage, handling, how long from source to table.

Commonly used animal derived oils/fats:    

Since animal oils are typically in the form of fats, which is a more complex molecule so they are solid at room
temperature and will be rendered down upon applying heat.

Foods containing larger amount of animal derived fats:

* Milk 
* Butter
* Cheese
* Lard
* [Ghee](https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/desi-ghee-should-you-go-with-the-advice-your-grandma-gave-you-1339282)

Kitchen rendering of fats:  butter into clarified butter, suet into tallow, pork fat into lard, and chicken fat into schmaltz

These can be broken in 3 groups

   * Saturated oils are solid at room temperature; this describes shortenings, margarine,
   and a few other commonly eaten oils.  Typically these processed fatty oils are derived from 
   animal sources.  They are considered to be relatively unhealthy because 
   they can contribute to higher cholesterol levels and heart disease.

   * Monounsaturated oils are liquid at room temperature but begin to solidify in the refrigerator.   These include olive oil and peanut oil.

   * Polyunsaturated oils remain liquid when at room temperature or when chilled. 
   These include canola, sunflower, and walnut oils (among others). 

Plus:

   * Trans fats are unsaturated fats that have been altered and behave like saturated fats. They can be found in some oils that have been heated during processing and in partially-hydrogenated fats in take-aways and are bad for health because they increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. 


## What happens when cooked

https://www.goodfood.com.au/good-health/are-you-cooking-with-the-right-oil-20150708-gi1agi:

> Refined oils are more stable and better suited to high-temperature cooking such as deep-frying than unrefined (mechanically pressed such as extra virgin) oils. These oils tend to have higher smoke points, the temperature zone at which the oil starts to break down and give off acrid and sometimes toxic fumes.
antioxidants start to disappear when you raise the temperature.

Oil behaves differently when heated, it changes texture, color, taste as well as it's nutritional properties. When the oil reaches its smoking point, a lot of the nutrients are destroyed and it can sometimes potentially form harmful compounds

## Superfood claims

Like all claims about a particular "superfood" that come and go mostly the advertising around this is just out to make some money, so beware.

The safe bet for most people is to have a moderate intake of vegetable oils; olive oil would probably place it as one of the safest of those and remains reasonably economical.
