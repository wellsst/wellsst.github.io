# About this

I write on things I have little clue on, this serves a number purposes:

* understand the topic
* remember it
* hope someone else will benefit from my layman's approach to a topic
* improve my writing ability

I aim to objective and base my writing on reputable sources.  

The goal is to write on a topic once a month and about 500 words.  

The blog source is kept on [github](https://github.com/wellsst/wellsst.github.io) and written in markdown (helped with Jekyll).  If you grab the source you can run locally with `bundle install` and then `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If you disagree or find an issue then fork and PR it, I'll review.  The beauty of this approach is anyone can take a topic, fork it and improve; hence the title.
