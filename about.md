# About this

I will write about topics I need to know more about or seek a clear explanation for.  This serves a number purposes:

* understand the topic
* remember it
* hope someone else will benefit from my layman's approach to a topic
* improve my writing ability

The writing principals should focus on succinctness, objectivity and be built on a base of reputable sources.  

The goal is to write on a topic once a month and about 500 words.  

The source is kept on [github](https://github.com/wellsst/wellsst.github.io) and written in markdown (helped with Jekyll).  If you grab the source you can run locally with `bundle install` and then `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If you disagree or find an issue then fork and PR it, I'll review.  The beauty of this approach is anyone can take a topic, fork it and improve; hence the title.
