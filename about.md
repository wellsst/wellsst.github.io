# About this site

I'm no expert, not at all on most of the things I'll read about.  But I try to
be objective.  This I write about to simply maintain and hopefully improve my
writing ability and to improve memory of the topics.

The aim is to write on the given topic once a month and about 500 words.  
This sounds achievable; even though I've tried to start such things a few times before this time I'd really really like to keep it going!

The text is stored on github and written in markdown (helped with Jekyll).  The beauty of this approach is anyone can take a topic, fork it and improve; hence the title...but not that I expect it to happen!
